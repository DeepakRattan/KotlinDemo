// Kotlin run
/* The context object is available as a receiver (this). The return value is the lambda result.
   : run does the same as with but invokes as let - as an extension function of the context object.
   : run  is useful when your lambda contains both the object initialization and the computation of the return value.
   : Similar to the let function, the run function also returns the last statement.
   : Unlike let, the run function doesnâ€™t support the it keyword.*/
